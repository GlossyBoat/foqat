## Overview

The FOQAT is an R package designed for quick processing and analysis of atmospheric data measured from field observation and air pollution. And the functions for time series analysis could also be applied to the time series of any other fields. 

The FOQAT stands for "Field observation quick analysis toolkit".

The FOQAT package is developed and maintained by Chen Tianshu from Professor Xue Likun's research group of Environmental Research Institute of Shandong University.  

For getting start or detail usage, please visit: [user manual](https://github.com/tianshu129/foqat/wiki/User-Manual) or [说明手册](https://www.yuque.com/foqat/doc) .
