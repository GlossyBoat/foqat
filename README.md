### News
2023/09/30  
If you are using a newer version of R (for example, version 4.3.1), please upgrade your FOQAT to the latest version (2.0.8.2).   
如果你正在使用新版本的R（例如4.3.1版本），请升级你的FOQAT至最新版本（2.0.8.2）。

### Overview

The FOQAT is an R package designed for quick processing and analysis of atmospheric data measured from field observation and air pollution (e.g., air-quality sensor/monitor data). And the functions for time series analysis could also be applied to the time series of any other fields. 

The FOQAT stands for "Field observation quick analysis toolkit".

The FOQAT package is developed and maintained by Chen Tianshu from Professor Xue Likun's research group of Environmental Research Institute of Shandong University.  

For getting start or detail usage, please visit: [Vignette](https://tianshu129.github.io/foqat/articles/) or [说明手册](https://www.yuque.com/foqat/doc) .  

If FOQAT is used to support a scientific publication, please cite the following reference:
